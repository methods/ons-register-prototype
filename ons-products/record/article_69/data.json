It begins by looking at the position of the five broad ethnic groups (employment and inactivity rates) in the labour market over time in England and Wales from 2001 to 2014 using data from the Labour Force Survey. It then uses 2011 Census data to undertake a more detailed cross sectional analysis using the full 18 ethnic group classification. It examines economic activity (employment, unemployment and economic inactivity) and characteristics of employment (occupation, industry and employment patterns) looking at male and female differences. It also explores young people (aged 16 -24) in the labour market.","contactEmail":"angela.potter-collins @ons.gsi.gov.uk","contactName":"Angela Potter-Collins","contactTelephone":"+44 (0)1633 455281","start-date":"","end-date":""}]
