This analysis explores some of the different factors that may affect the number of inter-ethnic relationships, including ethnic group, gender, age, type of relationship and dependent children. Exploring inter-ethnic relationships provides further insight into the patterns and trends of an increasingly ethnically diverse population. In 2011 nearly 1 in 10 people who were living as part of a couple were in an inter-ethnic relationship, an increase from 2001.","contactEmail":"angela.potter-collins @ons.gsi.gov.uk","contactName":"Angela Potter-Collins","contactTelephone":"+44 (0)1633 455281","start-date":"","end-date":""}]
