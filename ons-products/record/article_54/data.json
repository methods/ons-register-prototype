Analysis includes marital status, living arrangements, housing tenure, economic activity and general health and provision of unpaid care. In 2011, 9.2 million residents were aged 65 and over, an increase of almost 1 million from 2001 with 8.3 million. Results show that just 50% of those aged over 65 reported their health to be “very good” or “good”, compared with 88% of the rest of the population.","contactEmail":"chris.white@ons.gsi.gov.uk","contactName":"Chris W White","contactTelephone":"+44 (0)1633 455865","id":"article_54"}]
